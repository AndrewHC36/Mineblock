# Mineblock
This is based off the game Minecraft programmed in Rust using Vulkano as the wrapper around the Vulkan API.

## General Info
A game called Mineblock which was heavily inspired by Minecraft. And the reason I chose to use
Vulkano, a wrapper around a low-level GPU API, was to get my hands wet to understand each parts
how GPU works.

#### Future Development
This is considered as my primary hobby project, so expect continuos development over the years.

#### Current Status
Currently with only two chunks rendering with optimization towards transparent blocks.
No GUI/HUD of any sorts yet.
